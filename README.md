#  MediShare: Smart Medicine Redistribution Platform

##  Project Overview
MediiShare is an AI-powered platform designed to reduce medical waste and improve healthcare access by enabling the smart redistribution of unused, sealed medicines. It establishes a streamlined, three-level ecosystem:

*Donors (Hospitals & Pharmacies) upload surplus medicines.

*NGOs verify, collect, and manage the donations.

*Recipients (low-income clinics or communities) receive the medicines based on real-time needs.

By combining AI, OCR, and smart logistics, MediiShare ensures efficient, verified, and timely delivery of medicines‚Äîtransforming waste into life-saving support.

## Key Features 
*üîç OCR-Based Medicine Verification
Extracts medicine names, expiry dates, and active ingredients from uploaded images.
Uses tools like OCR Space, Google Vision API, and AWS Textract for accurate data capture.

*üß†  AI-Based Matching of Medicines
Analyzes similarity in composition and ingredient match between donated and required medicines.
Ensures recipients receive therapeutically equivalent drugs, not just exact matches.

*üìçLocation-Based Filtering with Maps
Leaflet.js is used for seamless map integration and location filtering.
Helps NGOs prioritize local matches and optimize logistics based on proximity.

*üí¨Multilingual Chatbot Support
Provides voice and text-based assistance to all stakeholders in multiple Indian languages.
Ensures inclusivity for NGOs, hospitals, and rural recipients.


## Problems Solved
*Medical Waste: Tackles the ‚Çπ15,000‚Äì‚Çπ18,000 crore worth of unused medicines wasted annually in India.

*Lack of Access: Bridges the gap for low-income communities that lack basic medicines.

*Environmental Pollution: Reduces pharmaceutical waste that pollutes soil and water.

*Inefficient Donation Systems: Replaces manual, unverified donation processes with AI, OCR, and smart logistics.

## Dependencies

1. Frontend: 
Node.js (Latest LTS),
React.js, Next.js, Vite,
Tailwind CSS,
Supabase SDK,
Leaflet(For map integration),
Recharts(for anayltics implementation)


3. Backend:

*üè• Integration with Government & Public Health Systems
Collaborate with national healthcare programs, public hospitals, and state-run clinics to scale operations, align with CSR initiatives, and support medicine access at a policy level.

*üöö Logistics & Cold Chain Partnerships
Partner with logistics providers and pharmaceutical supply chains to ensure secure, temperature-controlled, and efficient delivery of sensitive medicines.

*üîó Blockchain for Transparency & Compliance
Implement blockchain-based tracking to ensure transparency, authenticity, and legal compliance throughout the donation lifecycle‚Äîbuilding trust among donors, NGOs, and recipients.

*üìä Analytics Dashboard for Stakeholders
Introduce an advanced dashboard offering real-time analytics for NGOs, donors, and healthcare authorities to track impact, inventory, and optimize supply-demand chains.
